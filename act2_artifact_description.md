You find a small handheld gold artifact that you slip into your pocket.

The small golden artifact is about the size of a fist and has intricate designs etched onto its surface, depicting scenes of mythical creatures and ancient battles. 

It feels electric to the touch, yet also chilled. 

As you hold it, it feels like it is getting heavier. 

It has a secured lid that is not immediately obvious how to open.

You have a foreboding sense of fear as you handle this object.
