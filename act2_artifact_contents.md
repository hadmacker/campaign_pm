Inside the small golden artifact lies a perfectly cut, flawless diamond. It is large enough to fit comfortably in the palm of one's hand and shimmers with an otherworldly radiance. Its surface is smooth and unblemished, without a single scratch or imperfection.

It is clear that this diamond is not just any ordinary gemstone, but rather something incredibly ominous, radiating a dark magical aura that begins to drain the room of all light.

You close the artifact before others notice the effect, and commit yourself to investigating it further when you're on your own.
