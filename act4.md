# Act 3: Exploring The Lumber Mill

---

# Travel to the Lumber Mill

As the party emerges from the ruins of the burned-out mansion, the sky is painted in hues of orange and red as the sun sets behind the rolling hills. The air is thick with the scent of smoke and ash. The path ahead of the party is dimly lit, illuminated only by the soft glow of the magical map in their hands.

As they follow the map's trail, they soon arrive at an abandoned lumber mill. The once-bustling mill now stands silent, the wooden structure weathered and worn by years of neglect. The mill's waterwheel, which once turned with great force, now creaks and groans as it slowly rotates with the gentle flow of the nearby river.

The door to the mill is ajar, and the party can hear the distant sound of creaking floorboards, scampering rodents, and rustling leaves.

## Observing the surroundings

You hear a pair of voices that appear to be moving together through the compound. You suspect that they might be guarding the premesis.

# Entering the Lumber Mill

As they make their way inside, they see piles of sawdust and stacks of unused lumber, but there is no immediate evidence of anyone here. The air is musty and thick with the smell of rotting wood.

# Finding the false wall

As the party approaches the dusty wall, they notice that some of the dust is disturbed and there seems to be an outline of a door. As they investigate further, they notice that the outline is actually a false wall, cleverly disguised to blend in with the surroundings.

# It's trapped!

As they try to open the false wall, they trigger a trap, causing a shower of poisonous darts to shoot out from small holes on either side of the wall. The party will need to use their reflexes to avoid getting hit by the darts.

# On the other side of the false wall

Once the party has disarmed the trap and opened the false wall, they are greeted by a large room. 

As you scan the room's features, you identify a mezzanine and scaffolding providing a second level. This large room appears to be a storage room for drying wood. This is a large room, and you will need to continue exploring to see all the details of the room.

## Continue exploring
As you continue exploring this room, you observe a small armory lined up in a corner, with several sets of worthless armor and makeshift weapons. Near this armory you see a **chest** that appears out of place, under a section of mezzanine.

## Continue exploring

In the far corner of the room is a double door gate, closed. Just inside the doors, on the other side of a pile of lumber, you see a large horse-drawn cart stacked high with gunpowder kegs, fuse cord, and unlit torches. It's clear that someone's been using this lumber mill as a staging area for something big.

## Continue exploring

As you continue exploring, you hear a pair of voices outside. 


### The Mezzanine above is stacked with wooden boards

## The Chest

The chest is locked and trapped with a pressure plate that triggers a collapsing ceiling trap (the mezzanine above it). The party will need to find a way to bypass the pressure plate or disarm the trap to safely retrieve the contents of the chest.


### Springing the trap

If the trap is sprung, the target must roll a DEX save to dive out of the way. On failure they take 6d6 damage, or 3d6 on a successful save.

The players don't realize that this alerts the guards, and also the criminal mastermind.


### Inside this chest

Roll 5d4 for the following items inside the chest:

* **01: Potion of Superior Healing**: This potion restores 8d4+8 hit points when consumed. (DMG 187)
* **02: Potion of Invisibility**: This potion makes the drinker invisible for 1 hour. The potion is clear, and it smells like ozone. (DMG p. 187)
* **03: Potion of Frost Giant Strength**: This potion sets the drinker's Strength score to 25, granting a +7 bonus to Strength-based ability checks, attacks, and damage rolls. (DMG p.187)
* **04: Potion of Fire Resistance**: This potion gives the drinker resistance to fire for 1 hour. The potion is a translucent, oily liquid that swirls with color. (DMG p. 188)

**You also find 200 gold and a City Watch uniforms**

# Evidence of a Conspiracy

As the party examines the contents of the chest, they notice that there is a stack of gunpowder kegs precariously stacked in a corner of the room. The slightest misstep could cause the kegs to tumble and trigger a deadly explosion. The party will need to use their wits and agility to carefully navigate around the kegs and retrieve any valuable items without triggering a disaster.

## OPTION: With the gunpowder wagon, you also see a small satchel containing additional potions.

**Potion of Fire Resistance**: This potion gives the drinker resistance to fire for 1 hour. The potion is a translucent, oily liquid that swirls with color. (DMG p. 188)

# Introducing the Villain

As the party is searching through the warehouse, they hear a loud banging sound followed by the sound of creaking hinges as the double doors to the warehouse burst open. A hulking figure enters, dressed in dark robes with symbols of fire emblazoned on them, and his hair is wild and unkempt. In his hand, he holds a small glass vial filled with a strange green liquid.

"I have been watching you," he says, his voice low and dangerous. "You have seen too much. Now, you will pay the price."

As he says this, you observe several henchmen running into the room behind him.

With a flick of his wrist, The Villain throws the vial at the ground, and a thick cloud of green smoke billows up, obscuring him and his henchmen from view. The party hears the sound of footsteps and the clinking of metal.

Roll for initiative, at disadvantage.

# Beginning the fight

As the smoke clears, the villain stands before them, a wicked smile on his face. He is holding a torch, and the warehouse around them is suddenly illuminated in a flickering orange light. The party can see stacks of gunpowder kegs, crates of weapons, and other explosives lining the walls.

"You see, I have been preparing for this for a long time," he says. "The City Watch will fall, and a new order will rise in its place. And you, my dear adventurers, will not interfere any longer."

## Baddies

* BOSS: [Marcus Blackwood](./mob_marcusb.md)
* [Mercenary](./mob_mercenary.md)
* If the boss is defeated, minions will attempt to set the warehouse wagon (gunpowder) on fire. 
  * _**Y'all gonna die.**_
  
## Minions

`Cultists`: The BBEG could have a group of cultists who follow them and are willing to fight and die for their cause. These cultists could be lower-level spellcasters who can cast spells like magic missile or hold person to support the BBEG in combat. (See the Cultist stat block on p. 345 of the Monster Manual.)

`Shadow Demons`: These creatures are stealthy and can teleport in and out of combat, making them difficult to pin down. They also have a ranged attack that deals necrotic damage, which could help wear down the party. (See the Shadow Demon stat block on p. 64 of the Monster Manual.)

`Animated Armor`: These constructs are immune to poison and psychic damage, which could make them a good choice if the party has a lot of spellcasters. They also have a high AC, which could make them a good "meat shield" for the BBEG. (See the Animated Armor stat block on p. 19 of the Monster Manual.)

`Chain Devils`: These devils have a high AC and resistances to cold, fire, and lightning damage, which could make them a good choice if the party has a lot of damage-dealing spellcasters. They also have the ability to restrain creatures with their chains, which could help the BBEG control the battlefield. (See the Chain Devil stat block on p. 72 of the Monster Manual.)

"You see, I have always hated this city. Its people, its politics, its wealth, its...corruption. I was born in the slums of the Dock Ward, and I've been forced to watch as the rich and powerful of this city live in luxury while the rest of us suffer. But soon, that will all change. I will bring the city down into chaos, and rebuild it in my own image."


# OPTION: Kent Fey arrives

As the party is backed into a corner, with The Villain and his henchmen closing in for the final attack, they suddenly hear a loud explosion from outside the building. The walls shake and debris rains down from the ceiling. For a moment, it seems like the fight might be over before it's begun.

## Calm Emotions

He casts "calm emotions," causing the once-raging enemies to falter and hesitate. The Villain is visibly shaken and begin to take a step back.

* **Save DC: 14**
* Calm Emotions is a 2nd-level enchantment spell in D&D 5E, found on page 221 of the Player's Handbook.
* When cast, Calm Emotions suppresses strong emotions in a group of creatures. 
* Range: Targets a maximum of 8 creatures within a 20-foot radius sphere centered on a point chosen by the caster.
* Any creature affected by the spell that is currently frightened or charmed has that effect ended. 
* Creatures that are prone to becoming violent or aggressive, such as during combat, are calmed and cannot make attacks, cast spells, or use abilities that cause others to take damage.
* The effects of Calm Emotions last for the spell's duration, which is up to 1 minute when cast at its base level, but it can be extended by higher level spell slots. 
* The spell ends early if a creature affected by it takes damage or witnesses any of its friends being harmed.

## Intermission

As the dust settles, the players see a figure striding confidently through the door. It's Kent Fey. As he approaches the party, he lays his hands on them and channeling his divine energy. They feel a warm glow spread through their bodies, and their wounds begin to close up. The cleric's touch has restored their strength and vitality, healing 8d4+8 hit points and restoring them of all conditions, readying them for the final stand against their foes. 

"Stand firm, my friends," Kent says with a reassuring smile. "With the power of the divine on our side, we will emerge victorious."

# Round 2

## Monologue:

"Pearson was a fool. I needed to know whether the rumors were true that **The Necrosphere** had resurfaced after all those years, but Pearson was a moneygrubbing fraud. I couldn't detect any magical items with him. It's best for everyone that he's no longer with us. And it's best for everyone that your journey ends here."

## Fight!
