Help me create a D&D 5e campaign for 4 players at level 9, with film noir attributes. The plot should start with a VIP protection job offered by a private detective, and when the players arrive to do the job, it turns into a murder mystery for the players to solve after the VIP is violently murdered. This campaign should happen in or near the city of Waterdeep in Winter. This campaign should have 3 encounters, and include a few traps (and a trapped chest) and at least one puzzle.


mystery like puzzels, dead easy, subtle like a brick to the face, dramatic.

try to rescue the npc. razor thin margin or they die.

Flashbacks
Cynical heroes

Vicent: a protection job.
- see a crime on the side of the road. if they stop, the person is dead.
when they get there, the person is dead.
so this becomes a murder mystery.

augery or divination, they see the building but cannot recognize the surroundings. 
locate object: it's rapidly moving away. if you pursue it, you will have to abandon the current location.

# Shadows and Dim Light

Noir plays around a lot with shadows and silhouettes. We should probably be familiar with the rules on light so that we can get the most out of a shadow-y alley.

Dim Light: "The soft light of twilight...." This area is lightly obscured, meaning that creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.

Darkness: These areas are heavily obscured, meaning that a creature is effectively blinded (auto-fail ability checks involving sight, attack rolls have disadvantage, creatures have advantage to hit you).

Darkvision: In my experience, most characters have darkvision. Remember that "...a creature with darkvision can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light...". 

Also, creatures with darkvision can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. I think describing those scenes as without color can definitely enhance the noir feel.

Hiding: When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide. "When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden — both unseen and unheard — when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses."

It's film noir. There will be lots of villains hiding in the shadows trying to stab you in the back.

# Film Noir Plots

Here are the storylines that I was able to pull out of the various movies I watched.

Mystery Box: Mysterious enemies are trying to find a box containing a secret treasure. Possibly a soul, or a devastating living spell.

Treasure Hunters: Eccentric NPCs are all trying to find an object of great value, sabotaging each other and anyone else who gets in their way.

Spousal Murder: A spouse in a tight situation recruits the heroes to murder their partner. This one is all about planning the murder, and whether or not what they were told is even true.

Wayward Children: A father who is in poor health has two attractive adult children that have gotten mixed up with villains. The heroes must extract the kids from the situation without bringing attention to the wealthy father.

Missing Spouse: A spouse has fled their marriage, as their partner is a possessive criminal. The heroes are hired to go and find the spouse.

Murdered Acquaintance: The group meets someone and spends an evening with them. This person is murdered just after bidding the group farewell. The heroes are the only suspects - they must solve the crime to prove their innocence.

Non-Murder Murder: A person is murdered in their own home. People investigate.. then it turns out that the person who was murdered was actually on vacation. Who the dead person in their home actually is, is a mystery.

Secret Stash: A villain really wants a certain clock - because there is an item of value (a murder weapon) stashed within it.

Wrong Place: The group ends up traveling with a man who suddenly dies. It turns out that the man is a rich, influential criminal whose death can bring the group great wealth, so obviously they are murder suspects.


# Film Noir NPCs

These are some of the more interesting film noir NPCs I stumbled across. 

Unrequited Love: A sidekick who does anything for their boss, and the boss uses them without care.

Pathological Liar: An opportunist who will double cross anyone to achieve their goal, going so far as to impersonate a dead person if they can get away with it.

Evil Blackmailer: An antagonist who blackmails a character, sticking by their side, siphoning every last gold piece they can.

Mysterious Love: A character's ex-partner who mysteriously disappeared suddenly returns, now with a new partner who is seemingly a force for great good.

Black Widow: An amoral villain who marries people and then tricks other people that they seduce into killing the spouse, all for slight financial gain.

Devoted Servant: A butler/maid of a wealthy eccentric, who is in reality a former spouse who still sticks around out of concern for their ex's health and sanity.

Shady Lawyer: A lawyer who seems to be legitimate, but secretly has money problems and is willing to finance a heist. 

One Day From Retirement: A hired goon who just wants one big score so they can go home and rebuild their life.

The Geek: A person who works at a carnival, biting the heads off of chickens, acting crazy. How did they end up here?

Guard on the Take: A crooked cop more than willing to go in on a heist. A burly chess player who is up for committing a small crime to distract from a bigger crime taking place.
