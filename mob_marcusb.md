## Spells:

* **Eldritch Blast (PHB 236)**: A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range, dealing 1d10 force damage on a hit. At higher levels, the spell creates one additional beam for each spell level above 1st.
* **Charm Person (PHB 221)**: You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. If it fails a Wisdom saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance.

The warlock can also use a bonus action on their turn to move the zone up to 30 feet.
