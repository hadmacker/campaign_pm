## Exhaustion as a result of paranormal activity

The rules for exhaustion can be found on pages 291-292 of the Player's Handbook (PHB) for D&D 5E.

**Level 1: Disadvantage on ability checks**: At this level, the character is fatigued and can't push themselves as hard as they normally would. They have disadvantage on ability checks.

**Level 2: Speed halved**: The character's movement speed is halved. They also have disadvantage on ability checks.

**Level 3: Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws**: The character is now exhausted and struggling to keep going. They have disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws. They also have their movement speed halved.

**Level 4: Hit point maximum halved**: The character's hit point maximum is halved. They also have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and their movement speed is halved.

**Level 5: Speed reduced to 0**: The character can't move, and their speed is reduced to 0. They have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and their hit point maximum is halved.

**Level 6: Death**: At this level, the character dies.

These effects can be removed through rest, certain spells, or other effects as determined by the DM. It's worth noting that exhaustion can also be caused by environmental hazards, diseases, and other factors beyond combat or adventuring.
