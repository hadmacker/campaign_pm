# Act 2: The Investigation

---

# Clues

* Inspecting the body reveals a letter
* Vincent: Observes a wall panel out of place.
  * Finds a small handheld gold artifact.
    * ```
      The small golden artifact is about the size of a fist and has intricate designs etched onto its surface, depicting scenes of mythical creatures and ancient battles. It feels electric to the touch, yet also chilled. As you hold it, it feels like it is getting heavier. It has a secured lid that is not immediately obvious how to open.
      ```
    * Attempting to open the artifact:
      ```
      The first time someone attempts to open the artifact, they suddenly find themselves in a nightmarish daydream. The world around them dissolves into an ethereal, swirling mist that takes on the shape of a twisted, alien landscape.
          
      In this dreamlike realm, the user sees a figure looming in the distance, shrouded in shadow and mystery. As they approach the figure, they suddenly find themselves being pulled into a dark, murky pool of water that seems to extend into infinity.
          
      The water is cold and clammy, and the user feels a crushing weight pushing down on their chest, making it hard to breathe. As they struggle to stay afloat, they hear a voice whispering in their ear, taunting them and urging them to give up.
          
      Suddenly, the user is lifted out of the water by a giant hand that grabs them by the back of the neck. They are pulled out of the pool and thrown onto a rocky shore, gasping for breath.
          
      As they look up, they see the figure standing over them, a sinister grin on its face. The figure's features are indistinct, but the user can sense that it is filled with malice and darkness.
          
      The nightmare ends as suddenly as it began, leaving the user shaken and disoriented. They realize that they have been given a warning, that the artifact is not to be taken lightly, and that it possesses a power that must be wielded with caution and respect.
      ```
    * To open the artifact:
      ```
      To open the lid, one must first rotate the outer ring of the artifact clockwise until a small notch aligns with a specific symbol on the artifact's surface. This symbol depicts a dragon's head with its mouth open wide. Once the outer ring is aligned, the user must then push down on the dragon's head, causing the lid to pop open.
  
      The puzzle is not just about the correct alignment of the outer ring and the symbol, but also requires a bit of force to push down on the dragon's head to unlock the lid. Without the forceful push, the lid will not open and the contents inside will remain a mystery.
      ```
    * Inside this artifact:
      ```
      Inside the small golden artifact lies a perfectly cut, flawless diamond. It is large enough to fit comfortably in the palm of one's hand and shimmers with an otherworldly radiance. Its surface is smooth and unblemished, without a single scratch or imperfection. The diamond seems to emanate a faint, warm glow that fills the room with a soft, comforting light.

      It is clear that this diamond is not just any ordinary gemstone, but rather something incredibly rare, radiating with a dark magical aura that begins to drain the room of all light.
      ```


# Witnesses

`The hotel staff`: The hotel staff might have had a grudge against Pearson or might have been paid off to allow the killer access to his room.

`Pearson's business rivals`: Pearson had many business rivals who might have wanted him out of the way.

`The killer`: The killer might be someone who had a personal vendetta against Pearson or might have been hired to do the job.


## Encounters and Traps
During their investigation, the players will encounter a number of obstacles, including traps and combat encounters. Here are three possible encounters that you could use:

`The Ambush`: The players are ambushed by a group of thugs who have been hired to prevent them from investigating the murder.

`The Locked Room`: The players must solve a puzzle to escape from a locked room where they have been trapped by the killer.

`The Trapped Chest`: The players discover a chest that is booby-trapped with a deadly poison. They must use their skills to disarm the trap and open the chest without getting poisoned.

## Conclusion
After gathering all the clues, the players will have to confront the killer and bring them to justice. The killer might be a surprise twist, such as a minor character that the players had previously overlooked. Once the killer is caught, the players will be able to clear their names and complete their job, but they might also discover a larger conspiracy behind the murder that could lead to further adventures in the future.
