# Witnesses

## Witness 1: (Adjoining Room on the Left):

Me: "Excuse me, can you tell me about what you heard or saw on the night of the murder?"

Witness 1: "Yes, of course. I was in my room when I heard some commotion coming from the room next to mine. It sounded like things were being thrown around, and then I heard a loud thud."

Me: "Did you hear any voices or anything that could give us a clue as to who was in the room?"

Witness 1: "Well, I did hear some muffled voices, but I couldn't make out what they were saying. It was too loud to hear clearly, but it sounded like an argument of some sort."

Me: "Did you see anyone leaving the room?"

Witness 1: "No, I didn't see anyone leaving the room. But I did hear footsteps coming from the room, and they sounded like they were moving towards the door."

## Witness 2 (Adjoining Room on the Right)

Someone was begging for their life. 

They said something about bribing the other with an artifact in exchange for their life.

There was a struggle that ensued and lots of banging.

## Hotel Staff

Lockwood, yeah. There's a scummy landlord in the area with that name. Owns much of this street even. If it's run down and falling apart on this street, he owns it for sure. He owns an abandoned residence just south of here that is used as a common meeting point for questionable activities. The mansion burned to the ground almost ten years ago, yet was never rebuilt.

## Hotel Staff 2

Yeah, Lockwood. That's what the locals call the ghost house just near here. Weird stuff goes on there. There's a murder tour of the area and I'm pretty sure that's the tour's final destination because they always come here for drinks after.
