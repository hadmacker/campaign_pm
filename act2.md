# Act 2: The Investigation

---

# Clues


* Inspecting the body (or the room if empty) reveals a torn piece of paper.
  * Inspecting the paper:
    ```
    As the players search the murder scene, they notice a piece of paper on the floor near the bed. It appears to have been torn from a book or journal, and there is a single word written on it in what looks like blood: "Lockwood."

    None of the witnesses recall hearing or seeing anything related to Lockwood, they may come across a mention of a wealthy merchant named Lockwood who was rumored to have a hidden room in his estate where he kept his most valuable treasures.
    ```
* Vincent: Observes a wall panel out of place.
  * Finds a small handheld gold artifact.
    * ```
      The small golden artifact is about the size of a fist and has intricate designs etched onto its surface, depicting scenes of mythical creatures and ancient battles. It feels electric to the touch, yet also chilled. As you hold it, it feels like it is getting heavier. It has a secured lid that is not immediately obvious how to open.

      You have a foreboding sense of fear as you handle this object.
      ```
    * Attempting to open the artifact:
      ```
      The first time you attempt to open the artifact, you suddenly find themselves in a nightmarish daydream. The world around them dissolves into an ethereal, swirling mist that takes on the shape of a twisted, alien landscape.
          
      In this dreamlike realm, the user sees a figure looming in the distance, shrouded in shadow and mystery. As they approach the figure, they suddenly find themselves being pulled into a dark, murky pool of water that seems to extend into infinity.
          
      The water is cold and clammy, and the user feels a crushing weight pushing down on their chest, making it hard to breathe. As they struggle to stay afloat, they hear a voice whispering in their ear, taunting them and urging them to give up.
          
      Suddenly, the user is lifted out of the water by a giant hand that grabs them by the back of the neck. They are pulled out of the pool and thrown onto a rocky shore, gasping for breath.
          
      As they look up, they see the figure standing over them, a sinister grin on its face. The figure's features are indistinct, but the user can sense that it is filled with malice and darkness.
          
      The nightmare ends as suddenly as it began, leaving the user shaken and disoriented. They realize that they have been given a warning, that the artifact is not to be taken lightly, and that it possesses a power that must be wielded with caution and respect.

      If evil: While the effect is chilling and leaves you uneasy, the feeling is exhilerating and darkly enjoyable in the experience.

      If good: The effect is chilling and leaves you queasy. Constitution Save +15 (fail: vomit in the corner. Disadvantage on all skill checks for next 30 minutes.) You clearly recognize that this is powerful dark magic and a corruption that is not to be trifled with.
      ```
    * To open the artifact:
      ```
      To open the lid, one must first rotate the outer ring of the artifact clockwise until a small notch aligns with a specific symbol on the artifact's surface. This symbol depicts a dragon's head with its mouth open wide. Once the outer ring is aligned, the user must then push down on the dragon's head, causing the lid to pop open.
  
      The puzzle is not just about the correct alignment of the outer ring and the symbol, but also requires a bit of force to push down on the dragon's head to unlock the lid. Without the forceful push, the lid will not open and the contents inside will remain a mystery.
      ```
    * Inside this artifact:
      ```
      Inside the small golden artifact lies a perfectly cut, flawless diamond. It is large enough to fit comfortably in the palm of one's hand and shimmers with an otherworldly radiance. Its surface is smooth and unblemished, without a single scratch or imperfection.

      It is clear that this diamond is not just any ordinary gemstone, but rather something incredibly ominous, radiating a dark magical aura that begins to drain the room of all light.

      You close the artifact before others notice the effect, and commit yourself to investigating it further when you're on your own.
      ```


# Witnesses

`Witness 1` (Adjoining Room on the Left):

```
Me: "Excuse me, can you tell me about what you heard or saw on the night of the murder?"

Witness 1: "Yes, of course. I was in my room when I heard some commotion coming from the room next to mine. It sounded like things were being thrown around, and then I heard a loud thud."

Me: "Did you hear any voices or anything that could give us a clue as to who was in the room?"

Witness 1: "Well, I did hear some muffled voices, but I couldn't make out what they were saying. It was too loud to hear clearly, but it sounded like an argument of some sort."

Me: "Did you see anyone leaving the room?"

Witness 1: "No, I didn't see anyone leaving the room. But I did hear footsteps coming from the room, and they sounded like they were moving towards the door."
```

`Witness 2` (Adjoining Room on the Right)

```
Someone was begging for their life. 

They said something about bribing the other with an artifact in exchange for their life.

There was a struggle that ensued and lots of banging.
```

`Hotel Staff`: Lockwood, yeah. There's a scummy landlord in the area with that name. Owns much of this street even. If it's run down and falling apart on this street, he owns it for sure. He owns an abandoned residence just south of here that is used as a common meeting point for questionable activities. The mansion burned to the ground almost ten years ago, yet was never rebuilt.

`Hotel Staff 2`: Yeah, Lockwood. That's what the locals call the ghost house just near here. Weird stuff goes on there. There's a murder tour of the area and I'm pretty sure that's tour's the final destination because they come here for drinks after.
