The first time you attempt to open the artifact, you suddenly find themselves in a nightmarish daydream. The world around them dissolves into an ethereal, swirling mist that takes on the shape of a twisted, hellish landscape.

In this dreamlike realm, the user sees a figure looming in the distance, shrouded in shadow and mystery. As they approach the figure, they suddenly find themselves being pulled into a dark, murky pool of water that seems to extend into infinity.

The water is cold and clammy, and the user feels a crushing weight pushing down on their chest, making it hard to breathe. As they struggle to stay afloat, they hear a voice whispering in their ear, taunting them and urging them to give up.

Suddenly, the user is lifted out of the water by a giant hand that grabs them by the back of the neck. They are pulled out of the pool and thrown onto a rocky shore, gasping for breath.

As they look up, they see the figure standing over them, a sinister grin on its face. The figure's features are indistinct, but the user can sense that it is filled with malice and darkness.

The nightmare ends as suddenly as it began, leaving the user shaken and disoriented. They realize that they have been given a warning, that the artifact is not to be taken lightly, and that it possesses a corrupting dark power that must be wielded with great caution and restraint.

**If evil:** While the effect is chilling and leaves you uneasy, the feeling is _exhilerating_ and darkly enjoyable in the experience.

**If good:** The effect is chilling and leaves you queasy. Constitution Save +15 (fail: vomit in the corner. Disadvantage on all skill checks for next 30 minutes.) You clearly recognize that this is powerful dark magic and a corruption that is not to be trifled with.
