# Act 3: To Lockwood

---

* While in Lockwood, they are trapped in a puzzle room by a group of ghosts.
* They must defeat the ghosts or escape from a trapped room.
* If they can capture or befriend a ghost, it will tell them who they need to meet, and where (the house shifts)

# Entering Lockwood

```
As the players approach Lockwood, they can see that the once-grand medieval residence has been heavily burned and is now in ruins. The exterior walls are blackened and crumbling, and the roof has collapsed in several places. Weeds and vines have grown up around the building, and it looks like it has been abandoned for many years.

As the players step inside the building, they are immediately struck by an eerie and complete silence. There are no sounds of animals or birds, and the air is still and musty. The only light comes from small cracks in the walls and ceiling, and it is barely enough to see by.

A single hallway stretches out before them, seemingly endless, no doors. The walls are scorched and blackened, and cobwebs and dust cover everything. The floorboards creak underfoot, and the air is thick with the smell of smoke and decay.

After what seems like an eternity of walking, the players suddenly find themselves in a single room. The room is small and cramped, with no windows and a low ceiling. The walls are covered in grime and soot, and there is a musty smell in the air. Everything you touch is covered in soot and ash.

As the players begin to explore the room, they suddenly hear a loud click. They turn around to see that the door has slammed shut, and they are now trapped in the room.
```


# Investigating the room

The only thing in the room is a chest in the center. It looks old and battered, with rusted hinges and a tarnished lock. There is a riddle carved into the lid of the chest, and the players realize that the only escape is by solving the riddle.

You hear a horrifying moan.

> Frightful Moan (1/day). The ghost releases a mournful moan, and each creature within 60 feet of the ghost that can hear it and isn't an undead must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also drops to 0 hit points. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the ghost's Frightful Moan for the next 24 hours.

As they work on solving the riddle, they begin to hear strange noises from outside the room. It sounds like the whispers of ghosts, and the players feel a chill run down their spines. A horde of ghosts appears through the walls and confronts the players, demanding to know why they have trespassed in their domain.

The Ghosts begin to attack in waves.

# DECISION: Attempt to trap or communicate with ghost

On success: The ghosts allow the team to complete their puzzle, but pester the team, flying through and around them repeatedly.  all actions taken are at disadvantage

On failure: Anyone who fails trap/communication rolls against the Ghosts by more than 5 are pestered harder than the others. The ghosts fly around and through the individuals, caressing their items and body with a chilled touch. They will be unable to sleep with relentless night terrors every time they close their eyes for the next two nights (exhaustion), regardless of any cures attempted.

# Solving the riddle

> I am always hungry, I must always be fed.  
> The finger I touch, will soon turn red.  
> What am I?  

The answer to the riddle is "Fire".

Attempting to use a normal torch will result in a small blue flame that extinguishes itself after a short second. This makes the ghosts laugh and start chanting "Sapphirine Sapphirine".

Insight or Passive Perception:

> The party will notice that the ghosts avoid an unlit torch on the wall.

Attempting to light this torch results in a blue flame that doesn't appear to offer any light to the room. 

But this is't what the holder of the torch sees: As you hold this torch, you observe that all magical items on party members are glowing brightly. You also notice that the chest in the middle of the room glows brightest of all.

This torch is like the spell Detect Magic. The holder can see magical items glow within 30 feet.

The ghosts watch the party members as they unlock both the chest and the room with this puzzle, curious about what they will do next.

Inside the chest is a large assortment of fine gold jewelry inlaid with flawless gemstones.

The ghosts crowd around and move through the individual(s) inspecting the contents of the chest. As party members hold and examine objects, the ghosts pretend to do the same. As (player) holds a bracelet, a ghost tries to put it on, and wraps their hands around and through the player.

As the party lingers, the room begins to get colder and the ghosts continue encroaching closer to the players. For those party members pocketing items, they begin to exhale frost.

# CONSEQUENCE: Party members that take items from the chest will be unable to sleep for several days (but the items aren't haunted.)

# Leaving the Trap Room

As the players leave the trap room, they can't help but notice that the hallway has changed. They hardly have time to ponder what was previously an endlessly long and unchanging hallway before they arrive at another room. 

This room is filled with beautiful mahogany furniture, including towering bookcases with ancient books, many glowing with powerful magic, ornate carvings and rare artwork line the walls. The scent of old leather and parchment fills the air, adding to an atmosphere of intellectual intrigue. The room is warmly lit by numerous lamps and candles, casting a golden glow on the ornate carvings and diamond inlay elements of an intricate gothic ceiling. A grand cadelabra chandelier hangs from the ceiling, featuring carved gargoyles, lions, and other animals. The centerpiece of the room is an ornately carved Gothic desk, complete with numerous quills and ink pots.

Insight/Passive Perception:
* This room is too big for the residence. It's also prestinely preserved without a hint of the burned out ruins observed earlier.

As the party enters the room, they see a man sitting in a leather easy chair behind the desk, surrounded by stacks of rare and exotic items. This must be "The Fence," a well-established and notorious illegal art and magic items dealer. He wears a sharp black suit and a sly grin, his piercing blue eyes scanning the party as they approach. The room falls silent, and The Fence speaks in a low, smooth voice, "Welcome, my friends. What brings you to my humble abode?"

# Conversation with The Fence

## I kow of this Pearson. He had asked me to broker a deal for an artifact of immense danger and power, but was unable to provide evidence he had it.

## I'm not surprised he was murdered. My impression of him was, as we say, "Swimming with the Sharks." 

## I was not involved with Pearson's murder.

## Would you know anything about said artifact? It would be a shame if it was lost to... uncivilized hands.

## I am both everyone's best friend and everyone's worst enemy. There are countless rooms in this mansion that you wish to never see and might never escape if you do. And I could open every one of their doors directly here with the simplest incantation.

## Artifact has been shielded from divination magic and magical interference. This is one of the tricks allowing me to reside here uninterrupted all these years. It is also one of the reasons I rely on associates to find said item.

# Before the party leaves (or depending on what they ask)

## The Fence: I want what Pearson promised me, if it's true. 

As a symbol of our new found partnership, I will give you Pearson's murderer.

The Fence raises his left hand into the air, palm up. As he does so, he appears to pull an orb wrapped in silk out of thin air. He places it suspended in mid-air in front of him and unwraps the silk to reveal a glowing crystal ball, emitting a soft, pulsing light.

The Fence stands before the crystal ball, chanting softly under his breath. As he speaks, the crystal ball begins to glow brighter, and the room is filled with an otherworldly light.

Suddenly, the light intensifies, and you feel as if you're falling through time and space. You witness a gruesome murder, the victim being struck down by a cloaked figure. The vision blurs, and you find yourself transported back in time to witness the moments leading up to the murder.

Through the wizard's magic, you're able to see the killer meeting with a shadowy figure, who seems to be orchestrating the murder. You hear the criminal mastermind's voice, but you're unable to see their face.

The vision fades, and you're back in the wizard's study. "We have the information we need," he says, as a glowing map floats in front of him. He picks the formed map out of the air and hands it to you.

"now it's time to go."

## As Vincent leaves: The Fence gives him a prepared letter. "We have much to discuss about that which you possess." Strange. Your contact hasn't written on any paper since you arrived.

### :warning: Continuity Error?

* If "The Fence" can't divine the presence of the artifact, can he really know what Vincent possesses?
