# Act 3: To Lockwood

---

* While in Lockwood, they are trapped in a puzzle room by a group of ghosts.
* They must defeat the ghosts or escape from a trapped room.
* If they can capture or befriend a ghost, it will tell them who they need to meet, and where (the house shifts)

# Entering Lockwood

```
As the players approach Lockwood, they can see that the once-grand residence has been heavily burned and is now in ruins. The exterior walls are blackened and crumbling, and the roof has collapsed in several places. Weeds and vines have grown up around the building, and it looks like it has been abandoned for many years.

As the players step inside the burned out building, they are immediately struck by an eerie and complete silence. There are no sounds of animals or birds, and the air is still and musty. The only light comes from small cracks in the walls and ceiling, and it is barely enough to see by.

A single hallway stretches out before them, seemingly endless, no doors. The walls are scorched and blackened, and cobwebs and dust cover everything. The floorboards creak underfoot, and the air is thick with the smell of smoke and decay.

After what seems like an eternity of walking, the players suddenly find themselves in a single room. The room is small and cramped, with no windows and a low ceiling. The walls are covered in grime and soot, and there is a musty smell in the air. Everything you touch is covered in soot and ash.

As the players begin to explore the room, they suddenly hear a loud click. They turn around to see that the door has slammed shut, and they are now trapped in the room.
```


# Investigating the room

The only thing in the room is a chest in the center. It looks old and battered, with rusted hinges and a tarnished lock. There is a riddle carved into the lid of the chest, and the players realize that the only escape is by solving the riddle.

You hear a horrifying moan.

> Frightful Moan (1/day). The ghost releases a mournful moan, and each creature within 60 feet of the ghost that can hear it and isn't an undead must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also drops to 0 hit points. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the ghost's Frightful Moan for the next 24 hours.

As they work on solving the riddle, they begin to hear strange noises from outside the room. It sounds like the whispers of ghosts, and the players feel a chill run down their spines. A horde of ghosts appears through the walls and confronts the players, demanding to know why they have trespassed in their domain.

The Ghosts begin to attack in waves.

* For our new people, remember about Horrifying Visage.

# DECISION: Attempt to trap or communicate with ghost

On success: The ghosts allow the team to complete their puzzle, but pester the team, flying through and around them repeatedly. All actions taken are at disadvantage.

On failure: Anyone who fails trap/communication rolls against the Ghosts by more than 5 are pestered harder than the others. The ghosts fly around and through the individuals, caressing their items and body with a chilled touch. They will be unable to sleep with relentless night terrors every time they close their eyes for the next night (exhaustion +1), regardless of any cures attempted.

# Solving the riddle

> I am always hungry, I must always be fed.  
> The finger I touch, will soon turn red.  
> What am I?  

The answer to the riddle is "Fire".

Attempting to use a normal torch will result in a small blue flame that extinguishes itself after a short second. This makes the ghosts laugh and start chanting "Sapphirine Sapphirine".

Insight or Passive Perception:

> The party will notice that the ghosts avoid an unlit torch on the wall.

Attempting to light this torch results in a blue flame that doesn't appear to offer any light to the room. 

But this is't what the holder of the torch sees: As you hold this torch, you observe that all magical items on party members are glowing brightly. You also notice that the chest in the middle of the room glows brightest of all.

* [Blue Torch](./act2_bluetorch.md)

This torch is like the spell Detect Magic. The holder can see magical items glow within 30 feet.

The ghosts watch the party members as they unlock both the chest and the room with this puzzle, curious about what they will do next.

Inside the chest is a large assortment of **fine gold jewelry inlaid with flawless gemstones**. There are also **three scrolls**.

The ghosts crowd around and move through the individual(s) inspecting the contents of the chest. As party members hold and examine objects, the ghosts pretend to do the same. As (player) holds a bracelet, a ghost tries to put it on, and wraps their hands around and through the player.

As the party lingers, the room begins to get colder and the ghosts continue encroaching closer to the players. For those party members pocketing items, they begin to exhale frost.

# CONSEQUENCE: Party members that take items from the Act 2 chest will be unable to sleep for 1d4 days. Half if they pass a WIS DC 14 check.

# Leaving the Trap Room

As the players leave the trap room, they can't help but notice that the hallway has changed. They hardly have time to ponder what was previously an endlessly long and unchanging hallway before they arrive at another room. 

This room is untouched by fire and decay. Rather, it is filled with beautiful mahogany furniture, including towering bookcases with ancient manuscripts, many that are embossed with magic runes. (Player holding blue torch) You see that these manuscripts are glowing brightly.Ornate carvings and rare artwork line the walls. The scent of old leather and parchment fills the air, adding to an atmosphere of intellectual intrigue. The room is warmly lit by numerous lamps and candles, casting a golden glow on the ornate carvings and the ceiling's inlaid diamond shapes elements of an intricate gothic ceiling. A grand chandelier hangs, featuring carved gargoyles, lions, and other animals. The centerpiece of the room is an ornately carved Gothic desk, complete with numerous quills and ink pots.

Insight/Passive Perception:
* This room is too big for the residence. It's also prestinely preserved without a hint of the burned out ruins observed earlier.

As the party enters the room, they see a man sitting in a leather easy chair behind the desk, surrounded by stacks of rare and exotic items. This must be "The Fence," a well-established and notorious illegal art and magic items dealer. He wears a sharp black suit and a sly grin, his piercing blue eyes scanning the party as they approach. As he stands, the torches and candles in the room appear to increase in brightness and heat. The room falls silent, and The Fence speaks in a low, smooth voice, "Welcome, my friends. What brings you to my _humble_ abode?"

# Conversation with The Fence

## I kow of this Starhold. He had asked me to broker a deal for an artifact of immense danger and power, but was unable to provide evidence he had it.

## I'm not surprised he was murdered. My impression of him was, as we say, "Swimming with the Sharks.

## I will assure you that I was not involved with Starhold's murder.

## But while we're here, would you know anything about said artifact? It would be a shame if it was lost to... uncivilized hands.

## I am both everyone's best friend and everyone's worst enemy. There are countless rooms in this mansion that you wish to never see and might never escape if you do. And I could open every one of their doors directly here with the simplest incantation.

## About the Artifact

### Artifact has been shielded from divination magic and magical interference. This is one of the tricks allowing me to reside here uninterrupted all these years. It is also one of the reasons I rely on associates to find said item.

## Before the party leaves (or depending on what they ask)

### The Fence: I want what Starhold promised me, if it's true. 

To that end, and as a gesture of goodwill, I will give you Starhold's murderer.

The Fence raises his left hand into the air, palm up. As he does so, he appears to pull an orb wrapped in silk out of thin air. He places it suspended in mid-air in front of him and unwraps the silk to reveal a glowing crystal ball, emitting a soft, pulsing light.

The Fence stands before the crystal ball, chanting softly under his breath. As he speaks, the crystal ball begins to glow brighter, and the room is filled with an otherworldly light.

Suddenly, the light intensifies, and you feel as if you're falling through time and space. You witness a gruesome murder, the victim being struck down by a cloaked figure. You observe as the cloaked figure ransacks the room but leaves empty handed. The vision blurs, and you find yourself transported further back in time to witness events before to the murder.

Through the wizard's magic, you're able to see the killer meeting with a robed figure in an abandoned lumber mill, who seems to be orchestrating the murder. You hear the criminal mastermind's voice, but you're unable to see their face.

The vision fades, and you're back in the wizard's study. "We have the information we need," he says, as a glowing map floats in front of him. He picks the formed map out of the air and hands it to you.

"now it's time to go."

## As Vincent leaves: The Fence gives him a prepared letter. "We have much to discuss about that which you possess." Strange. Your contact hasn't written on any paper since you arrived.

### :warning: Continuity Error?

* If "The Fence" can't divine the presence of the artifact, can he really know what Vincent possesses?

# Leaving the room

As you open the door to leave the room, you step down out of the room and onto the street in front of the burned out building. The door closes behind you.

## If the party attempts to re-open the door...

When you open the door, you see a burned out building. The room you returned from no longer exists.
