# Act 1: From Protection to Murder

## Arriving at the Inn

You make your way through the city, the sound of your footsteps echoing against the old stone buildings. As you turn a corner, you come across a small, seedy inn with a sign that reads "The Rusty Dagger." The tavern attached to the inn spills out onto the street, its patrons raucous and boisterous.

Vincent gestures to the group that this is the establishment where you will meet your VIP, Brathin Starhold.

Entering the tavern, you're hit by the smell of ale and sweat. The room is dimly lit, with only a few flickering candles casting an eerie glow. You take a seat at a rickety table, the wood creaking beneath your weight.

Vincent takes out a red scarf and wraps it around his neck, the signal that was to signify to your VIP that the team is ready for his arrival.

As you sit and enjoy the local brew, you can't help but notice the odd characters that inhabit the tavern. A group of rough-looking mercenaries huddle in a corner, while a shady-looking half-elf sits alone at the bar, eyeing you suspiciously. The bartender, a grizzled dwarf with a thick beard, grunts as he slides another mug of ale your way.

Despite the seedy atmosphere, you can't help but feel a sense of camaraderie with your party. You've been through thick and thin together, and you know that whatever dangers lie ahead, you can count on each other to get through it. As the night wears on and the tavern grows louder, you all share a laugh and raise your mugs in a toast to the adventures that lie ahead.

# DECISION: Speak to half-elf

As the party speaks to the shady half-elf at the bar, "Yeah, I know him. He was looking for you. He went around out around the side for a piss. A little too much ale you know. Follow me". The half-elf quickly suggests they follow him to a dark alleyway just around the corner. 

Do you follow him?

# DECISION: Follow the half-elf (into a trap!)

The party, eager to meet their contact, follows him into the dark and narrow passage.

As they walk deeper into the alley, they notice a group of menacing figures leaving the tavern with them cutting off their escape. The half-elf quickly turns around, drawing a hidden blade and demanding that the party hands over all their valuables. It becomes clear that the party has been lured into a trap, and the half-elf was in on it all along.

The thugs, armed with clubs and rusty knives, close in on the party, ready to pounce at any moment. The party must now fight for their lives against their attackers.

# The contact doesn't show

As the night wears on, your party finds themselves waiting at the inn's tavern for their contact to arrive. The murmur of conversation fills the air as patrons come and go, but there's no sign of your contact.

The atmosphere is tense as your party begins to wonder if something has gone wrong. It's getting late, and your contact is now very overdue. The tavern begins to empty out as patrons head home for the night. The bartender begins to clean up, giving your party a pointed look to the door as he starts to lock up bottles and glasses. You can't help but feel a sense of unease, wondering if something has gone wrong or if your contact has set you up.

Should you wait a little longer, or give up and try to track down your contact on your own? The tension in the air is palpable, as you weigh your options and try to figure out your next move.

## CONSEQUENCE: Delayed due to fighting thugs in Act 0.

Nothing happens, party does not witness assassin leaving.

## DECISION: Wait? Get kicked out.

The bartender gives your party a final, pointed look, indicating you're being kicked out for the night. It's time to leave. You gather your belongings and prepare to head out into the night, feeling frustrated and disappointed at the lack of progress.

Just as you're about to exit the tavern, something catches your eye. A dark figure is running out of a second-story window and climbing over the roof. You quickly alert your party members, and together you make your way outside to get a better look.

The figure is agile, moving quickly across the rooftop with haste.


## DECISION: Attack the figure

[Valerian, 14 Rogue](./mob_Valerian.md)

The figure tries to escape and not fight if possible, using the following strategy:

If Valerian enters combat and wants to attempt to escape and hide on his first turn, he could take the "Dash" action to double his movement speed and move as far away from his enemies as possible. Then, he could use his "Cunning Action" feature to take the "Hide" action as a bonus action, using his surroundings for cover to attempt to hide from his enemies.

If Valerian is able to successfully hide, his enemies will have to use an action to locate him before they can attack him. He could then use his subsequent turns to continue moving and hiding, using his ranged attacks or other abilities to attack from a distance while avoiding close combat.

On Valerian's defeat, he drops an encyphered letter.

As you loot the body, you discover a second encyphered letter.

### Decrypting the letter

While the letter confirms a meeting place it doesn't indicate its location and further investigation is needed.


## DECISION: Ask the Bartender or Bar Maid for the contact

You approach the bartender and ask if he's seen anyone fitting the description of your contact. The bartender takes a moment to think, furrowing his brow in concentration before responding.

"I think I remember someone like that. Skittish, scared-looking fella, kept to himself," he says slowly. "Was asking if a guy named Vincent was here yet."

### On successful Charisma Check:

"I didn't catch his name, but he was carrying a small wrapped package with him. Seemed pretty intent on keeping it hidden."

The bartender shakes his head. "Sorry, can't say I remember much else. He was in a hurry to leave, didn't seem like he wanted to be seen."


## CONSEQUENCE: Further delays and distraction led the City Watch to investigate. 

Door has a sign what says "Keep Out. City Watch business", and magic seal on it that cannot be broken. You will be unable to enter the room that way. But maybe you can find another way in? (2nd Storey Window)


# Moving up to the Room

As the players ascend the creaky stairs of the inn, the musty scent of old wood and damp plaster fills their nostrils. The dim light of flickering candles and lanterns casts shadows that dance and sway on the walls, lending the hallway a sense of eerie, otherworldly ambiance.

As they approach their contact's door, they feel a breeze, and notice that the door is slightly ajar, as though someone has just left the room. A chill runs down their spines as they sense that something isn't quite right.


## The Murder

As the players cautiously push open the door to the VIP's room, they immediately sense that something is amiss. The air is thick with the coppery scent of blood, and a chilling breeze blows through the room, stirring the curtains and sending papers fluttering across the floor.

The room itself is in disarray, with furniture overturned and items scattered haphazardly across the floor. Blood spatters the walls and floor, and in the center of the room lies a body, face down, sprawled out in a pool of crimson.

### If the victim hasn't been removed by the City Watch...

The sight is enough to make even the most seasoned adventurer's stomach turn. Even from the bad angle, it's clear that the throat has been slashed, and the wound is still fresh and glistening with blood. The killer was both ruthless and skilled, able to strike swiftly and lethally.

As the players cautiously approach the body, they notice a few other details that might prove useful in their investigation. The room has been ransacked, and a few scattered papers have spilled out onto the floor. Some papers are stuck under the victim and are quickly being enveloped in blood.

### If the victim has been removed by the City Watch...

* A pair of watchmen are stationed around the building. You will need to sneak past them to investigate further.

The sight is enough to make even the most seasoned adventurer's stomach turn. Even from the bad angle, it's clear that the victim was bled out. The floor is covered in blood. Some spots are still wet. There's no doubt among the party that the victim was not coming back to this plane of existence.

As the players cautiously approach the crime scene, they observe that the room has been ransacked and a few scattered papers have spilled out onto the floor. One torn piece of paper appears out of place, floating on top of the puddle of blood.
